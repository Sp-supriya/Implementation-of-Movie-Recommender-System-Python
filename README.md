## 🎬 Movie Recommender System using Python

This project demonstrates the **implementation of a basic Movie Recommender System** using Python. Recommender systems are powerful tools that provide personalized suggestions to users by analyzing past behavior and item characteristics. They are widely used in platforms like Netflix, YouTube, Amazon, and Spotify.

### 📌 Project Description

A recommender system is designed to predict and suggest items (in this case, movies) that a user may find interesting based on their preferences or behavior. This project implements two popular recommendation approaches:

---

### 🤝 Types of Filtering Techniques

#### 1. **Collaborative Filtering**

This method makes recommendations based on user-item interactions. It assumes that if two users liked similar items in the past, they will like similar items in the future.

> 📌 *Example:* If User A likes movies X and Y, and User B likes movies Y and Z, the system may recommend movie Z to User A.

#### 2. **Content-Based Filtering**

This method uses item features (like genres, directors, or actors) and the user’s past preferences to make recommendations.

> 📌 *Example:* If a user frequently watches action movies, the system recommends more action-packed films.
